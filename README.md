# Deep-Learning-Tele-Robotic
◆ 1. Design and build circuits using various sensors, actuators and microcontrollers. ◆ 2. Design and build a self-navigating robot. ◆ 3. Build secure network links over the cloud to control the robots, and to relay back sensor and image data. ◆ 4. Build deep neural networks using industry standard tools like Tensorflow and to visualize the neural networks using tools like Tensorboard. ◆ 5. Produce meaningful analytics and pattern information using the deep learning tools and data relayed back by the robots.
